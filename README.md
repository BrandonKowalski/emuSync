# emuSync

A utility for syncing ROMs, Saves, Configuration and more to and from your Android-Based Emulation Handheld.

## Current Status

Just starting! ðŸ˜…

I'm working on building out a CLI and then hopefully will start working on the UI stuff.

## About

*I have too many handhelds.*

I adore my Retroid Pocket Classic and Retroid Pocket 5, but it can be a little
tedious moving files around.

Inspired by how straightforward it is to manage my Analogue Pocket
with [Pocket Sync](https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync), I wondered if I could create something similar for
Android-Based Emulation Handhelds.
